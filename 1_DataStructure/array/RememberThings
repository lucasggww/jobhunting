2. Java 1-D dimentional clone() is deep copy.
    arr2 = arr1.clone()
    arr1 and arr2 have difference memory locations.


    multi-dimentional array.clone() is shadow copied.

    int a[] = new int[10]{1,2,3};
    int b[] = a; //shadow copy, a, b points to the same reference.

    int b[]= new int[](a); //deep copy.

    clone() is deep copy
